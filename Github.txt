Github:

Github is an awesome reasource, it allows you to upload aton of files to a database and keep track of them.
One of the bonuses of having that ability is the chance to access those files from any computer using github or gitkrackin
to make things simpler. I think its cool that there is somewhere that we can always stash our work and never loose them. 
Another cool thing about Github is that it tracks every Commit or save of your file, so if you screw something up you 
can go back and find the file that works. It is a great tool to use not only in a personal space but and office and 
professional case as well. Github also allows you to send certain files and have them accessable to your other 
co workers or members in your team. Git hub is a great resourse for anyone that works on a computer all the time. 
Github allows you to fork repos that creates an oppurtunity to branch off and work off a project while not effecting 
the orginal! I am glad that we will be using git in our class!
